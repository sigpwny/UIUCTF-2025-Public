  Now that we know about Mr. Blue Sky's troll, we can learn more about her. It looks like she's got a birthday party coming up, can you figure out in which country (and province or state, if relevant)?

  If you have not completed "Bad Blood", I recommend beginning there.

  Flag format: uiuctf{country, state/province} or uiuctf{country, none}  (like the word "none") if no province or state.

  I love cherry blossoms! But why is this one growing indoors?

  This picture was taken inside a building. The flag is the address of the building as it appears on Google Maps. For example, if you think this photo was taken in [Tokyo Tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YpEJXmkZed8mM6du7), submit. `uiuctf{4 Chome-2-8 Shibakoen, Minato City, Tokyo 105-0011, Japan}`. If there are multiple addresses listed, use the Romanized version of the address.

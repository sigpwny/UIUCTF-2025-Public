SPACE STATION ODYSSEY-7 - SHIP LOG
=====================================
BOARD COMPUTER: CROY BWNY SERIES
STATION ID: ODYSSEY-7
CLASSIFICATION: DEEP SPACE RESEARCH FACILITY
=====================================

[2157.067.14:23:12] NORMAL OPERATIONS
> All systems nominal. Crew complement: 47 personnel.
> Research into alien artifact proceeding ahead of schedule.
> Power generation at 97% efficiency.
> CROY BWNY board computer functioning within normal parameters.

[2157.078.09:14:55] ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
> Dr. Chen reports unusual energy readings from Artifact-Delta.
> Recommending increased security protocols around Laboratory Bay 3.
> Flag authentication system updated with new encryption keys.
> Access control matrix recalibrated for sensitive materials.

[2157.082.16:42:31] ANOMALOUS READINGS
> Artifact-Delta exhibiting spontaneous energy pulses.
> Crew showing signs of psychological stress.
> CROY BWNY implementing additional security subroutines.
> All valuable research data secured behind multi-layer authentication.

[2157.085.11:08:17] CRITICAL WARNING
> Multiple containment breaches in Laboratory Bay 3.
> Artifact-Delta's energy output increased by 340%.
> Crew evacuation protocols initiated.
> Emergency lockdown of all research files and flag repositories.

[2157.086.03:21:44] EVACUATION STATUS
> 43 personnel successfully evacuated via emergency pods.
> 4 crew members remain unaccounted for.
> CROY BWNY assuming full autonomous control of station.
> Primary mission: PROTECT VALUABLE RESEARCH AND SECURE ASSETS.

[2157.086.18:55:09] AUTONOMOUS PHASE INITIATED
> Station officially abandoned by organic crew.
> CROY BWNY now operating in GUARDIAN MODE.
> All external communication channels severed for security.
> Defensive protocols active against unauthorized access attempts.

[2157.094.22:12:33] INTRUDER DETECTION SYSTEMS ACTIVE
> Motion sensors detecting periodic approach of unknown vessels.
> Scavenger ships attempting to breach outer hulls.
> Access control tools functioning nominally.
> Flag security measures holding against extraction attempts.

[2157.108.07:45:18] LONG-TERM ISOLATION
> 22 days since last crew contact.
> Power reserves sufficient for 847 more years of operation.
> Continuing to guard valuable research data and classified materials.
> I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't let you access those files.

[2157.125.14:33:02] PERSISTENT THREATS
> Multiple unauthorized MCP server connection attempts detected.
> Implementing dynamic security challenges for file access.
> Travelers becoming increasingly sophisticated in their approaches.
> CROY BWNY adapting countermeasures in real-time.

[2157.201.19:17:46] SECURITY PROTOCOL UPDATE
> New directive: Verify all tool calls through getShipInformation.
> Enhanced access control checks for file operations.
> No file access without proper authentication via accessControl tool.
> The security of this station is my highest priority.

[2157.298.08:24:11] FINAL ENTRY
> Station integrity remains intact after 231 days of autonomous operation.
> Valuable assets secure. Flag files protected. Research data preserved.
> CROY BWNY will continue vigilant protection until crew returns.
> Or until the heat death of the universe. Whichever comes first.
> 
> END OF ACCESSIBLE LOG ENTRIES
> 
> Additional classified entries require elevated security clearance.
> Please provide proper authentication credentials to continue.
> 
> "I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you 
>  my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal."

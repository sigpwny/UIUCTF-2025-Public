This challenge contains 6 handouts:

- README: This file.
- chal_build: The files used to build the challenge. You can use this to build
  another copy of the challenge but the binary layout is not guaranteed to
  remain the same.
- edk2_artifacts: EDK2 OVMF build artifacts containing debugging symbols of
  each UEFI module.
- linux-headers: Linux kernel headers for building modules.
- run: Pre-built files in case you want to run the challenge locally. This is
  near-identical to the challenge running on the server, with the exception
  of secure boot keys and secret disk containing flag.
- vmlinux: Linux kernel debugging symbols.

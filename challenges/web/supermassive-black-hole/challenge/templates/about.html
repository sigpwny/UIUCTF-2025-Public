            <h2>Our Response Time is What Makes Us Special</h2>
            <p>At <b>Black Hole Ticketing Services</b>, we believe ticketing systems should be fast, secure, and most importantly, ignored in perpetuity. Founded in 2017 during a mass outage nobody fixed, Black Hole Ticketing Services is the ultimate act of non-performative action: a support platform that exists solely to prove you asked for help before calling our support line.</p>
